        <h2>Introducing The Mind, Body, Soul Balance Guide</h2>
        <p>The Mind, Body, Soul Balance Guide is designed to help you align your mind, body, and soul so that you can
            become a happier, healthier, and more balanced you.</p>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mockup-1.jpg" alt="ebook">
        <p>The guide will challenge you to rethink what you’ve been told about balance and instead define it in your own
            terms. After all, balance means nothing unless you figure out what it means to you. The exercises,
            questions, and planners in this guide will help you get clear on your vision for balance and teach you how
            to nourish your mind, body, and soul every single day.</p>

            <li>
                <h4>How long will this guide take to complete?</h4>
                <p>Since this is totally self-paced, it’s up to you! The idea is that you’ll create a monthly self-care
                    action plan, so leave yourself some time for preparation and action taking!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Can I go through the guide more than once?</h4>
                <p>Yes! That is exactly why I created the guide digitally. I wanted a tool that you could come back to
                    whenever you crave balance in your life. Since it’s a digital workbook, it’s yours to revisit again
                    and again.</p>

            <li>
                <h4>What is your refund policy?</h4>
                <p>Because of the electronic nature of the guide, we are unable to offer refunds after your purchase is
                    complete.</p>
