        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>I know how stressful life can be. As a perfectionist, overthinker, and serial over-committer, I know that so
            many of my struggles are caused by the pressure I put upon myself.</p>
        <p>I spent many years of my life holding myself back from doing what I truly wanted to do in life because I was
            letting life happen to me instead of for me.</p>
        <p>Eventually I decided it was time to stop holding myself back. I found ways to prioritize my mental
            well-being, let myself relax, and quit letting perfectionism get in the way of my goals.</p>

        <p>Since starting this blog in 2014, I've gone back to school to get my master's degree in Wellness Coaching,
            and I even took the leap into self-employment to live life on my own terms.</p>
        <p class="bold">As someone who has been where you are, let me tell you, you have more power over your life than
            you think you do.</p>
        <p>That's why everything I share on The Blissful Mind is created to help you find a sense of calm in your
            everyday life. I like to think of this space as a virtual yoga studio where you can go to relax, unwind, and
            reset.</p>

        <h1>Who I Am</h1>
        <div class="flexed">
            <div class="content">
                <p>When I’m not busy with The Blissful Mind, you can catch me following a Yoga with Adriene video (love
                    her!),
                    taking way too many pictures of flowers, and scouring Yelp for a new restaurant to try.</p>
                <p>People have always described me as calm and laid back, and I think it’s because I’m pretty in-tune
                    with
                    my
                    mind, body, and soul. Life is all about balancing those elements!</p>
                <p>I received my Master of Arts in Health & Wellness Coaching from the Maryland University of
                    Integrative
                    Health
                    in 2017 with an emphasis in Integrative Health.</p>
                <p>I love Parks & Recreation, buying new stationery (seriously, it’s a problem), and sipping multiple
                    cups
                    of
                    tea all day, every day.</p>
