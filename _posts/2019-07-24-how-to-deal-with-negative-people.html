<p>Does other people’s negative energy bring you down? Maybe it’s your coworkers, family members, or even friends you’ve grown apart from.</p>

<p>When you’re surrounded by negativity, it’s easy to absorb that energy and start to feel negative yourself. This can mess with your mindset and make you feel drained.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s so important to be around people who you easily connect with and who uplift your spirits. We all know that’s not always possible though, especially since we don’t get to choose our family members or coworkers. </p>

<h2>How Negativity Affects Us</h2>
<p>We’ve all dealt with negative, frustrated, and overbearing people in our lives. I remember working with someone who was in a state of panic. They were trying to figure something out at the last minute and were clearly frustrated that things weren’t going to plan. In turn, I was getting frustrated because they were being impatient and sassy towards me.</p>

<p>A quote that an old coworker used to say came to mind:</p>

<p class="quote">“Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine.”</p>

<p>Whatever it is, you can feel yourself being affected when you’re around them. Most of us tend to absorb the mood of whoever’s around us, so how do we avoid letting negative people drain our energy when we can’t escape them? Here are a few tips to help:</p>

<h2>How To Deal With Negative People</h2>
<h3>1. Detach</h3>
<p>The ability to calm your mind when you’re under pressure is crucial to a healthy mindset. When your thoughts are all over the place, it’s difficult to see things as they really are. Calmness comes when you bring awareness to what’s happening and what you’re thinking. By figuring out go-to strategies and practices that calm your mind, you can center yourself and recognize when you’re overthinking or worrying about insignificant details.</p>

<h3>2. Avoid Blame</h3>
<p>Having a clear idea of what’s important to you is key to dealing with indecision. So much of our brain space gets taken up when we’re unsure of who we are and what we want. When you get clear on your priorities, goals, and values, you can remove the overwhelm that comes from uncertainty.</p>

<h3>3. Respond Calmly</h3>
<p>One of the biggest contributors to an unhealthy mindset is a lack of compassion towards yourself. When you’re constantly comparing yourself to others, pressuring yourself to be perfect, and doubting your own abilities, you only sabotage your success. Compassion allows you to accept yourself, set healthy expectations, and trust yourself and the journey you’re on.</p>

<h3>4. Be Firm</h3>
<p>Concentration is about commitment and dedication to yourself. We live in the age of distractions, which makes it all too easy to lose track of what’s important to you and even who you are. When you focus on what other people are doing instead of your own path, you get stuck. Focusing on what matters and making sacrifices with your time allows you to follow through and actually make progress.</p>

<h3>5. Find The Positive</h3>
<p>Courage helps us take action. When we procrastinate and avoid taking action, we keep ourselves stuck. Courage might sound like it’s about taking big, scary leaps into the unknown, but sometimes courage is as small as tackling a simple task you’ve been putting off. Courage allows us to take imperfect action, and that action helps us to build confidence, resiliency, and strength within ourselves.</p>
