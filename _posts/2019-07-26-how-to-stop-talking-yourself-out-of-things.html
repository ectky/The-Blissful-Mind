<p>How many times have you come up with a brilliant idea for something only to psych yourself out of doing it? If you’re
  an overthinker or perfectionist, you probably talk yourself out of doing things on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Maybe you get all up in your head and convince yourself it’s no longer a good idea even though you were super excited
  about it before. Perhaps you pick apart your ideas and focus on what could go wrong instead of what could go right.
</p>
<p>Though it’s important to think things through and weigh the pros and cons, overthinking is often a form of
  procrastination that leads to inaction. In order to find success, you have to take imperfect action instead of living
  in your head.</p>

<p>In this post, I’m sharing the common reasons why we talk ourselves out of things, how that can sabotage your success,
  and ways you can take action instead of letting your ego get in the way. </p>

<h2>Why We Talk Ourselves Out Of Things</h2>
<p>One of the biggest reasons you talk yourself out of things is because you think you don’t have the confidence to
  succeed. The keyword here is *think*. When you start to overanalyze your confidence levels, you pick apart the things
  about yourself that you’re not confident in. This only convinces you that you shouldn’t take action.</p>

<p>This also happens if you overthink things to death. When you go on tangents in your head until you’ve thought of all
  of the worst case scenarios, you start to fear the negative outcomes. But really, you’ve just created these negative
  outcomes in your own head.</p>

<p class="quote">When you continue this pattern of talking yourself out of things, you eventually make yourself believe
  that you’re
  not good enough to make changes in your life. You reignite that belief every time you decide to avoid or not do
  something.</p>

<p>Maybe you worry what people will think of you if you don’t succeed. This takes the focus back to the negative outcome
  again which creates more resistance towards a positive outcome. People are going to think what they think of you
  regardless. They’ll either judge you because you messed up or they’ll judge you because you never made an effort to
  change. </p>


<h2>How To Stop Talking Yourself Out Of Things</h2>
<h3>Don’t wait until you’re ready</h3>
<p>There is power in planning, but planning often becomes a form of procrastination because you avoid doing the work. We
  plan because we want to feel prepared and ready, but there is really no such thing as feeling ready.</p>

<p>Instead, you have to build your confidence by doing little things every day that take you out of your comfort zone.
  Whatever the big thing is that you want to do, break it down into smaller steps and push aside any self-sabotaging
  thoughts come up. Don’t let perfectionism or the need to be ready give you a reason to procrastinate. </p>

<h3>Work on your mindset</h3>
<p>Above all else, you need a strong mindset in order to get out of your comfort zone. A strong mindset gives you the
  confidence to take action and helps you become aware of the moments when you’re sabotaging yourself. Create a mindset
  routine like this one that helps you cultivate healthy thoughts about yourself and focus on what you want to
  accomplish.</p>

<p>I hope this post has encouraged you to get out of your own head and believe in your own ideas. By doing things before
  you’re ready, working on your mindset, and holding yourself accountable, you’ll start to see big changes in your life.
